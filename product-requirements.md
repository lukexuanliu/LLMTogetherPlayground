# LLM Together Playground - Product Requirements

## Overview
A simple, no-frills LLM playground application that integrates with Together.ai's inference API. This application provides a straightforward interface for interacting with large language models without unnecessary complexity.

## Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Allow users to send prompts to Together.ai's LLM API
2. Configure key parameters for LLM inference:
   - Model selection
   - Temperature
   - Max tokens
   - Top-p
   - Top-k
   - Repetition penalty
   - Stop sequences
   - Frequency penalty
3. Display LLM responses clearly
4. Maintain a history of prompts and responses
5. Allow users to clear history
6. Support for securely storing API key locally for easy usage

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Simplicity**: Maintain a clean, minimal interface without unnecessary features
2. **Performance**: Fast response times and minimal latency
3. **Security**: Secure handling of API keys (stored locally, not transmitted in client-side code)
4. **Usability**: Intuitive interface that requires minimal training
5. **Maintainability**: Clean, well-organized code for future maintenance

## Out of Scope
1. User authentication system
2. Persistent cloud storage of conversations
3. Chat-style UI with conversation threading
4. Advanced prompt templating
5. Complex integrations with other APIs

## Security Considerations
- API keys will be stored locally in environment variables
- API keys should never be exposed in client-side code
- API keys should never be committed to version control
